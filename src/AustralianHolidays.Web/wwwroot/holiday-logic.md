## Public Holiday Substitution Rules

When public holidays fall on weekends, Australian states and territories have different rules about whether a substitute weekday holiday is provided. This section documents these substitution rules for all major public holidays.


### New Year's Day (January 1)

**New South Wales** - Additional day when on weekend

- When January 1 falls on a weekday → observed on 1st January
- When January 1 falls on Saturday → **Both** Saturday (1st January) **and** Monday (3rd January) are public holidays
- When January 1 falls on Sunday → **Both** Sunday (1st January) **and** Monday (2nd Jan) are public holidays
- **Important**: This is **additional**, not substitution - both the actual January 1 date AND the Monday are public holidays

**All Other States**

- New Year's Day is always observed on 1 January, regardless of the day of the week
- No substitute holidays are provided when it falls on a weekend


### Australia Day (26 January)

**All States and Territories** - Substitution (Monday replaces weekend day)

- When 26 January falls on a weekday → observed on 26 January
- When 26 January falls on Saturday → **Only** Monday (28 Jan) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- When 26 January falls on Sunday → **Only** Monday (27 Jan) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- **Important**: This is **substitution**, not additional - the actual 26 January date is NOT a public holiday when it falls on a weekend, only the Monday substitute counts
- This is consistent across all Australian states and territories


### ANZAC Day (25 April)

ANZAC Day is observed on 25 April each year. When 25 April falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), some Australian states and territories provide an **additional** public holiday on the following Monday.

**Important**: The Monday is an "additional" holiday, not a "substitution" - both the actual 25 April **and** the Monday are public holidays. The Monday provides workers with an extra day off since the actual ANZAC Day fell on a non-working day.


#### States with Additional Day Off

**Western Australia** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (25 Apr) → Monday (27 Apr) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (25 Apr) → Monday (26 Apr) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- **Established**: 1972 via Public and Bank Holidays Act 1972

**Queensland** - Sunday only

- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- No substitute when ANZAC Day falls on Saturday
- **Established**: Holidays Act 1983

**Australian Capital Territory** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 27) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- **Established**: Approximately 2020, confirmed for 2026

**Northern Territory** - Sunday only

- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- No substitute when ANZAC Day falls on Saturday


#### States Without Additional Day

ANZAC Day is always observed on April 25, regardless of the day of the week. No additional Monday holiday is provided when April 25 falls on a weekend.

  - If Dec 26 is Sunday → "Proclamation Day" + Monday Dec 27 "Proclamation Day (additional)"
- Note: Only one additional day even when Christmas is also on weekend
