## Public Holiday Substitution Rules

When public holidays fall on weekends, Australian states and territories have different rules about whether a substitute weekday holiday is provided. This section documents these substitution rules for all major public holidays.


### New Year's Day (January 1)

**New South Wales** - Additional day when on weekend

- When January 1 falls on a weekday → observed on January 1
- When January 1 falls on Saturday → **Both** Saturday (Jan 1) **and** Monday (Jan 3) are public holidays
- When January 1 falls on Sunday → **Both** Sunday (Jan 1) **and** Monday (Jan 2) are public holidays
- **Important**: This is **additional**, not substitution - both the actual January 1 date AND the Monday are public holidays
- **Reference**: [NSW Public Holidays](https://www.nsw.gov.au/about-nsw/public-holidays)

**All Other States**

- New Year's Day is always observed on January 1, regardless of the day of the week
- No substitute holidays are provided when it falls on a weekend


### Australia Day (January 26)

**All States and Territories** - Substitution (Monday replaces weekend day)

- When January 26 falls on a weekday → observed on January 26
- When January 26 falls on Saturday → **Only** Monday (Jan 28) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- When January 26 falls on Sunday → **Only** Monday (Jan 27) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- **Important**: This is **substitution**, not additional - the actual January 26 date is NOT a public holiday when it falls on a weekend, only the Monday substitute counts
- This is consistent across all Australian states and territories

**Historical Weekend Occurrences**:

- **2030**: Saturday (upcoming) - Jan 28 (Mon) will be the observed holiday


### ANZAC Day (April 25)

ANZAC Day is observed on April 25 each year. When April 25 falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), some Australian states and territories provide an **additional** public holiday on the following Monday.

**Important**: The Monday is an "additional" holiday, not a "substitution" - both the actual April 25 **and** the Monday are public holidays. The Monday provides workers with an extra day off since the actual ANZAC Day fell on a non-working day.
