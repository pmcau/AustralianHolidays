<p>When public holidays fall on weekends, Australian states and territories have different rules about whether a substitute weekday holiday is provided. This section documents these substitution rules for all major public holidays.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day (1 January)</h3>
<p><strong>New South Wales</strong> - Additional day when on weekend</p>
<ul>
<li>When 1 January falls on a weekday → observed on 1 January</li>
<li>When 1 January falls on Saturday → <strong>Both</strong> Saturday (1 January) <strong>and</strong> Monday (3 January) are public holidays</li>
<li>When 1 January falls on Sunday → <strong>Both</strong> Sunday (1 January) <strong>and</strong> Monday (2 January) are public holidays</li>
<li><strong>Important</strong>: This is <strong>additional</strong>, not substitution - both the actual 1 January date AND the Monday are public holidays</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Other States</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Year's Day is always observed on 1 January, regardless of the day of the week</li>
<li>No substitute holidays are provided when it falls on a weekend</li>
</ul>
<h3>Australia Day (26 January)</h3>
<p><strong>All States and Territories</strong> - Substitution (Monday replaces weekend day)</p>
<ul>
<li>When 26 January falls on a weekday → observed on 26 January</li>
<li>When 26 January falls on Saturday → <strong>Only</strong> Monday (28 January) is a public holiday, labeled &quot;Australia Day (observed)&quot;</li>
<li>When 26 January falls on Sunday → <strong>Only</strong> Monday (27 January) is a public holiday, labeled &quot;Australia Day (observed)&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Important</strong>: This is <strong>substitution</strong>, not additional - the actual 26 January date is NOT a public holiday when it falls on a weekend, only the Monday substitute counts</li>
<li>This is consistent across all Australian states and territories</li>
</ul>
<h3>ANZAC Day (25 April)</h3>
<p>ANZAC Day is observed on 25 April each year. When 25 April falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), some Australian states and territories provide an <strong>additional</strong> public holiday on the following Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The Monday is an &quot;additional&quot; holiday, not a &quot;substitution&quot; - both the actual 25 April <strong>and</strong> the Monday are public holidays. The Monday provides workers with an extra day off since the actual ANZAC Day fell on a non-working day.</p>
