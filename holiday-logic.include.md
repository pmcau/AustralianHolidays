## Public Holiday Substitution Rules

When public holidays fall on weekends, Australian states and territories have different rules about whether a substitute weekday holiday is provided. This section documents these substitution rules for all major public holidays.


### New Year's Day (January 1)

**New South Wales** - Additional day when on weekend

- When January 1 falls on a weekday → observed on January 1
- When January 1 falls on Saturday → **Both** Saturday (Jan 1) **and** Monday (Jan 3) are public holidays
- When January 1 falls on Sunday → **Both** Sunday (Jan 1) **and** Monday (Jan 2) are public holidays
- **Important**: This is **additional**, not substitution - both the actual January 1 date AND the Monday are public holidays

**All Other States**

- New Year's Day is always observed on January 1, regardless of the day of the week
- No substitute holidays are provided when it falls on a weekend


### Australia Day (January 26)

**All States and Territories** - Substitution (Monday replaces weekend day)

- When January 26 falls on a weekday → observed on January 26
- When January 26 falls on Saturday → **Only** Monday (Jan 28) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- When January 26 falls on Sunday → **Only** Monday (Jan 27) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- **Important**: This is **substitution**, not additional - the actual January 26 date is NOT a public holiday when it falls on a weekend, only the Monday substitute counts
- This is consistent across all Australian states and territories


### ANZAC Day (April 25)

ANZAC Day is observed on April 25 each year. When April 25 falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), some Australian states and territories provide an **additional** public holiday on the following Monday.

**Important**: The Monday is an "additional" holiday, not a "substitution" - both the actual April 25 **and** the Monday are public holidays. The Monday provides workers with an extra day off since the actual ANZAC Day fell on a non-working day.


#### States with Additional Day Off

**Western Australia** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 27) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- **Established**: 1972 via Public and Bank Holidays Act 1972


**Queensland** - Sunday only

- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- No substitute when ANZAC Day falls on Saturday
- **Established**: Holidays Act 1983


**Australian Capital Territory** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 27) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- **Established**: Approximately 2020, confirmed for 2026


**Northern Territory** - Sunday only

- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (Apr 25) → Monday (Apr 26) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- No substitute when ANZAC Day falls on Saturday


#### States Without Additional Day

ANZAC Day is always observed on April 25, regardless of the day of the week. No additional Monday holiday is provided when April 25 falls on a weekend.

 * Victoria
 * Tasmania
 * South Australia


### Christmas Day (December 25) and Boxing Day (December 26)

**Most States** (NSW, VIC, TAS, WA, ACT, QLD, NT)

- Christmas Day (Dec 25) and Boxing Day (Dec 26) are always observed on their actual dates
- When either or both fall on a weekend, additional weekday holidays are provided:
  - If only **one** falls on weekend → One "Christmas (additional)" on the next weekday after Boxing Day
  - If **both** fall on weekend (Sat/Sun) → Two "Christmas (additional)" days on the following Monday and Tuesday
- Examples:
  - **2026**: Christmas Friday, Boxing Day Saturday → Monday Dec 28 is "Christmas (additional)"
  - **2027**: Christmas Saturday, Boxing Day Sunday → Monday Dec 27 and Tuesday Dec 28 are both "Christmas (additional)"

**South Australia** - Special "Proclamation Day" rules

- December 25 is always "Christmas Day"
- December 26 is called "Proclamation Day" (instead of Boxing Day)
- Substitution rules:
  - If Dec 26 is a weekday → "Proclamation and Boxing Day"
  - If Dec 26 is Saturday → "Proclamation Day" + Monday Dec 28 "Proclamation Day (additional)"
  - If Dec 26 is Sunday → "Proclamation Day" + Monday Dec 27 "Proclamation Day (additional)"
- Note: Only one additional day even when Christmas is also on weekend
