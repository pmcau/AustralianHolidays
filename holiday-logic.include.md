## Public Holiday Substitution Rules

When public holidays fall on weekends, Australian states and territories have different rules about whether a substitute weekday holiday is provided. This section documents these substitution rules for all major public holidays.


### New Year's Day (1st January)

**New South Wales** - Additional day when on weekend

- When 1st January falls on a weekday → observed on 1st January
- When 1st January falls on Saturday → **Both** Saturday (1st January) **and** Monday (3rd January) are public holidays
- When 1st January falls on Sunday → **Both** Sunday (1st January) **and** Monday (2nd January) are public holidays
- **Important**: This is **additional**, not substitution - both the actual 1st January date AND the Monday are public holidays

**All Other States**

- New Year's Day is always observed on 1 January, regardless of the day of the week
- No substitute holidays are provided when it falls on a weekend


### Australia Day (26th January)

**All States and Territories** - Substitution (Monday replaces weekend day)

- When 26th January falls on a weekday → observed on 26th January
- When 26th January falls on Saturday → **Only** Monday (28th January) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- When 26th January falls on Sunday → **Only** Monday (27th January) is a public holiday, labeled "Australia Day (observed)"
- **Important**: This is **substitution**, not additional - the actual 26 January date is NOT a public holiday when it falls on a weekend, only the Monday substitute counts
- This is consistent across all Australian states and territories


### ANZAC Day (25th April)

ANZAC Day is observed on 25th April each year. When 25th April falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), some Australian states and territories provide an **additional** public holiday on the following Monday.

**Important**: The Monday is an "additional" holiday, not a "substitution" - both the actual 25th April **and** the Monday are public holidays. The Monday provides workers with an extra day off since the actual ANZAC Day fell on a non-working day.


#### States with Additional Day Off

**Western Australia** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (25th April) → Monday (27th April) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (25th April) → Monday (26th April) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- **Established**: 1972 via Public and Bank Holidays Act 1972


**Queensland** - Sunday only

- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (25th April) → Monday (26th April) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- No substitute when ANZAC Day falls on Saturday

**New South Wales** - Both Saturday and Sunday

- When ANZAC Day falls on Saturday (25th April) → Monday (27th April) is "Anzac Day (additional)"
- When ANZAC Day falls on Sunday (25th April) → Monday (26th April) is "Anzac Day (additional)"

### Christmas Day (25th December) and Boxing Day (26 December)

**Most States** (NSW, VIC, TAS, WA, ACT, QLD, NT)

- Christmas Day (25 December) and Boxing Day (26th December) are always observed on their actual dates
- When either or both fall on a weekend, additional weekday holidays are provided:
  - If only **one** falls on weekend → One "Christmas (additional)" on the next weekday after Boxing Day
  - If **both** fall on weekend (Sat/Sun) → Two "Christmas (additional)" days on the following Monday and Tuesday
- Examples:
  - **2026**: Christmas Friday, Boxing Day Saturday → Monday 28th December is "Christmas (additional)"
  - **2027**: Christmas Saturday, Boxing Day Sunday → Monday 27th December and Tuesday 28th December are both "Christmas (additional)"

**South Australia** - Special "Proclamation Day" rules

- 25th December is always "Christmas Day"
- 26th December is called "Proclamation Day" (instead of Boxing Day)
- Substitution rules:
  - If 26th December is a weekday → "Proclamation and Boxing Day"
  - If 26th December is Saturday → "Proclamation Day" + Monday 28th December "Proclamation Day (additional)"
  - If 26th December is Sunday → "Proclamation Day" + Monday 27th December "Proclamation Day (additional)"
- Note: Only one additional day even when Christmas is also on weekend
